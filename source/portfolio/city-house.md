# City House

With an emphasis on fresh, local ingredients, Nashville&rsquo;s City House infuses Italian cuisine with country style. A logo, graphic identity, signage and responsive website were then created with the goal of bringing to life a clean expression of a farm-to-table mentality while paying homage to their signature oven, imported directly from Italy.

You&rsquo;re gonna want to call ahead.
