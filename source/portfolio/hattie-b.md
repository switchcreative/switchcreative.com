# Hattie B's

Hattie B&rsquo;s takes Nashville&rsquo;s chicken game and steps it up in a big way. Just like its recipe, the brand was created from scratch. From the name, graphic identity, signage and interior, to a responsive website, a comprehensive brand experience was developed with one foot in the past and one firmly planted in the present.

Delicious, indeed.
